<p>You are a puppet created by Geppetto who’s caught in a web of lies with unimaginable monsters and untrustworthy figures standing between you and the events that have befallen the world of Lies of P.

    You are awakened by a mysterious voice that guides you through the plagued city of Krat 
    <br>- a once lively place that has been poisoned by madness and bloodlust. <br>
    In our soulslike, you must adapt yourself and your weapons to face untold horrors, <br>
    untangle the unfathomable secrets of the city's elites and choose whether to confront predicaments with the truth or weave lies to overcome them on the journey to find yourself.</p>
